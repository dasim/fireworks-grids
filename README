Just a small command script I created to generate 12 columns guidelines grid in Fireworks. More grid combinations probably to come when I need them.

Especially useful together with cssgrid.net.

Tested only in Adobe Fireworks CS5. Use the Adobe Extension Manager to install the command.

The script is originally based on Nathan Smith's 960.gs grid generator for Fireworks. Thanks!
